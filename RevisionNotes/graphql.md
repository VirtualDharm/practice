developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls.

advantages of graphql :

1. Ask for what you want âˆ’ and get it (jo kaam sql krti thi ab api karegi, backend wala sql tk pahuch gya & km APIs create krni hongi). 
2. GraphQL is strongly typed and the queries are based on fields and their associated data types.

two ways to connect to graphql database : 

GraphQL Server with Connected Database (ek request aayi db se cheeze leke aaye)

GraphQL Server Integrating Existing Systems (ek request aayi db se, microservice se, restful se, 3rd API se info)
