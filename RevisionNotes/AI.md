## Neural Networks

- **Input Layer**: Where data first enters the model.
- **Hidden Layers**: Where computations happen, allowing the network to learn patterns.
- **Output Layer**: Final decision or prediction is made here.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Enables machines to understand and generate human language. Key tasks include:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into smaller components (words or subwords).
- **Parsing**: Understanding the structure of sentences.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the tone of the text (positive, negative, neutral).

---

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

- **LLMs** are neural networks designed to process vast text data, understanding language patterns and context.
- **Tasks**: Answering questions, writing essays, translating languages, etc.
- **Core Idea**: Predicting the next word in a sentence.

---

## The Transformer Architecture

- **Transformers** revolutionized NLP by efficiently handling sequences of data.
- Introduced in the paper *Attention Is All You Need*.
- Traditional models like **RNNs** struggled with long sequences; transformers solve this using an **attention mechanism**.
- Used in modern models like **GPT-4**.

---

## Language Modeling

- Helps LLMs understand word probabilities, enabling coherent text generation.

---

## Tokenization

Sentences are split into smaller units called **tokens**. 

- **Subword Tokenization**: Breaking words into smaller meaningful parts.  
  Example: `"It's raining"` becomes `["It", "'", "s", "rain", "ing", "."]`.

---

## Embeddings

- Converts tokens into numerical vectors for easier model processing.  
  Example:
  - `cat → [1.2, 0.5]`
  - `dog → [1.1, 0.6]`
  - `car → [4.0, 3.5]`

---

## Training & Fine-Tuning

- **Pre-training**: LLMs are trained on general datasets like *The Pile* and *CommonCrawl*.
- **Fine-tuning**: The model is further trained on specific datasets (e.g., Reddit Posts) for specialized tasks.

---

## Context Size

- Determines the maximum number of tokens a model can process at once.
- Example: **GPT-3.5 Turbo** can handle 16,000 tokens, whereas **GPT-4-0125** can handle up to 128,000 tokens.

---

## Scaling Laws

Performance depends on factors like:

- **Number of Parameters**
- **Training Data Size**
- **Computational Power (FLOPs)**

---

## Prompts

Clear and context-rich prompts improve output quality.  
Example: Instead of *“Write about Allama Iqbal,”* say *“Write a 500-word article on the great poet Allama Iqbal.”*

---

## Challenges

- **Hallucinations**: Models might generate incorrect facts.
- **Bias**: Reflects biases in training data, leading to skewed outputs.
